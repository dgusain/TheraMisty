## Step-by-Step Activities:

### Activity 1: Greeting Role-Play
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Description:** The therapist and Ethan will engage in a role-play activity where they practice formal greetings (e.g., “Hello, how are you?”). The therapist will model different scenarios using flashcards, prompting Ethan to respond appropriately.
- **Purpose:** This activity aims to establish a foundation for initiating conversations and practicing polite language.

### Activity 2: Turn-Taking Game
- **Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Description:** Using an interactive board game that requires players to engage in discussions, Ethan will practice taking turns while sharing thoughts or answering questions related to the game's theme. The therapist will guide the flow of conversation and encourage eye contact.
- **Purpose:** This reinforces the concept of turn-taking and provides a fun, engaging way to practice conversational exchanges.

### Activity 3: Storybook Discussion
- **Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Description:** The therapist will read a storybook that features a formal event. After reading, they will discuss the characters' dialogues, focusing on how they interact politely. Ethan will be encouraged to identify and role-play responses.
- **Purpose:** This activity helps Ethan contextualize polite language and social cues within narratives, promoting comprehension and application in real-life situations.

### Activity 4: Whiteboard Visualization
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Description:** The therapist will use the whiteboard to visually demonstrate key concepts, such as appropriate greetings and responses. Ethan will be encouraged to draw or write examples on the board.

- **Activity 3 Edge Case:** If Ethan has difficulty identifying responses in the story, the therapist can guide him with leading questions or examples to facilitate understanding.
- **Activity 4 Edge Case:** If Ethan is hesitant to participate in writing or drawing, the therapist can offer to demonstrate first or use a collaborative approach where they work together on the board.
- **Activity 5 Edge Case:** If Ethan feels discouraged about his performance, the therapist should focus on highlighting his strengths and improvements, ensuring a supportive environment.

        ### Session Plan ###

        # Therapy Session Plan: Semantic Intervention for Receptive Language Disorder

## 1. Session Overview:
This therapy session focuses on Semantic Intervention, specifically emphasizing the categorization of animals by their habitats. The aim is to enhance Liam's understanding of semantic categories, improve his vocabulary related to animals and their environments, and ultimately aid his ability to articulate and comprehend descriptive language.

## 2. Objectives:
1. Liam will accurately categorize at least 5 animals into their respective habitats with 80% accuracy.
2. Liam will demonstrate improved vocabulary by using 3 new descriptive words related to animals and habitats during the session.
3. Liam will engage in a discussion about the characteristics of at least 3 different habitats, showing comprehension of the material.

## 3. Materials Needed:
- Laptop with digital presentation of animals and habitats
- Animal figurines (e.g., lion, dolphin, camel)
- Picture cards depicting animals and their habitats
- Age-appropriate storybooks featuring animals and habitats
- Whiteboard and markers
- Visual sorting chart categorizing animals by their habitats

## 4. Step-by-Step Activities:

### **Activity 1: Introduction to Habitats**
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Description:** Begin with a brief introduction to the different habitats (jungle, ocean, desert, savannah) using a colorful poster. Show images of the habitats on the laptop and ask Liam to name any animals he associates with each habitat. 
- **Purpose:** This activity serves to activate prior knowledge and engage Liam in the topic, setting the stage for further exploration.

### **Activity 2: Animal Sorting Game**
- **Duration:** 20 minutes
- **Description:** Provide Liam with a set of animal figurines and picture cards. Ask him to sort the animals into groups based on their habitats using the visual sorting chart. As he sorts, prompt him to describe why each animal belongs in that habitat.
- **Purpose:** This hands-on activity reinforces semantic categorization and allows Liam to practice vocabulary and descriptive language in a fun, interactive way.

### **Activity 3: Vocabulary Expansion**
- **Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Description:** Introduce 3 new vocabulary words related to habitats (e.g., "oceanic," "arid," "tropical"). Use the whiteboard to write the words and draw simple illustrations. Discuss the meanings and contexts of these words. Encourage Liam to create sentences using each new word.
- **Purpose:** This activity focuses on vocabulary acquisition and enhances Liam’s ability to articulate ideas effectively.

### **Activity 4: Reading and Discussion**
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Description:** Select a storybook that features animals from different habitats. Read aloud to Liam, pausing to ask questions about the animals and their environments. Encourage Liam to predict what will happen next in the story.
- **Purpose:** This reading activity promotes listening comprehension, further vocabulary development, and encourages Liam to think critically about the material.

### **Activity 5: Reflection and Closing**
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Description:** Engage Liam in a brief reflection on what he learned during the session. Ask him to share his favorite animal or habitat and why. Provide positive feedback on his progress and participation.
- **Purpose:** This closing activity reinforces learning, encourages self-reflection, and fosters a sense of accomplishment.

## 5. Edge Case Handling:
- **Challenge 1:** If Liam appears disinterested during activities, introduce a reward system for participation (e.g., stickers for correct categorization).
- **Challenge 2:** If Liam struggles to categorize animals, provide additional visual aids or examples to guide him.
- **Challenge 3:** If Liam becomes frustrated or overwhelmed, take a short break and use a calming strategy, such as deep breathing or a brief physical activity.

## 6. Timing and Flow:
- Introduction to Habitats: 10 minutes
- Animal Sorting Game: 20 minutes
- Vocabulary Expansion: 15 minutes
- Reading and Discussion: 10 minutes
- Reflection and Closing: 5 minutes
- **Total Duration:** 60 minutes

## 7. Feedback and Reflection:
Encourage positive feedback throughout the session, especially during the sorting game and vocabulary expansion. At the end of the session, ask Liam how he felt about the different activities, allowing him to express his thoughts and feelings about the learning experience.

## 8. Homework Assignment:
Assign Liam to choose one animal from each habitat discussed and create a simple drawing or collage that depicts the animal in its habitat. Encourage him to write a sentence about each animal using the new vocabulary words learned during the session.

## 9. Conclusion:
Summarize the key achievements of the session, highlighting Liam’s success in categorizing animals, new vocabulary acquisition, and his engagement in the reading activity. End on a positive note, emphasizing the progress made and expressing excitement for the next session.
