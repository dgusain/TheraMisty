# TheraMisty

TheraMisty is a social robot with multimodal capabilities, created for the purpose of providing speech language therapy to children. TheraMisty employs a complete LLM-driven approach to control the social robot **MISTY 2**, not only removing humans from the equation but also enhancing the capabilities of the robot.

Currently under progress, this approach has been able to achieve a near-real-time latency of **1.71 seconds**, while the robot holds an expressive conversation with the human.

  MISTY's response latency decreases as the conversation goes on.
