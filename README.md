# TheraMisty
TheraMisty is a social robot with multimodal capabilities, created for the purpose of providing speech language therapy to children. TheraMisty employs a complete LLM-driven approach to control the social robot MISTY 2, not only removing humans from the equation, but also enhancing the capabilities of the robot. 

Currently under progress, this approach has been able to achieve a near-real time latency of 1.71 seconds, while the robot holds an expressive conversation with the human.
