# TheraMisty

TheraMisty is a social robot with multimodal capabilities, created for the purpose of providing general therapy to humans. Being a social robot, Misty utilizes Google's speech recognition to maintain a conversation with the users, providing a safe space to talk, listen and share their feelings. Integrated with a lightweight multimodal LLM (like meta-llama-3.2-1b, meta-llama-3.2-3b, meta-llama-3.2-11b), Misty generates human-like responses with memory, while still maintaining full data privacy by performing operations from a commodity server. Further on, with its ability to express emotions like happines, sad, anger, worried, concerned, and thoughtfulness, Misty is able to engage users with a seamless conversation experience. 

Currently, Misty can hold a conversation with users at a latency of 1.74 seconds on average. Just like humans think before they speak, Misty holds a thoughtful face, while its embedded systems process the response on the backend.
